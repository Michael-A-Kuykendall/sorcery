# Contributing to Sorcery

Thank you for your interest in Sorcery! 🧙

## Open Source, Not Open Contribution

Sorcery is **open source** but **not open contribution**.

- The code and notation are freely available under the MIT license
- You can fork, modify, use, and learn from it without restriction
- **Pull requests are not accepted by default**
- All notation design, doctrine changes, and merge decisions are made by the project maintainer

This model keeps the notation coherent, maintains clear ownership, and ensures consistent design philosophy. It's the same approach used by SQLite and many specification projects.

## How to Contribute

If you believe you can contribute meaningfully to Sorcery:

1. **Email the maintainer first**: [michaelallenkuykendall@gmail.com](mailto:michaelallenkuykendall@gmail.com)
2. Describe your background and proposed contribution
3. If there is alignment, a scoped collaboration may be discussed privately
4. Only after discussion will PRs be considered

**Unsolicited PRs will be closed without merge.** This isn't personal — it's how this project operates.

## What We Welcome (via email first)

- Bug reports in example spells or rehydrated code (Issues are fine)
- Security vulnerability reports (please email directly)
- Documentation improvements (discuss first)
- New example libraries/spells (discuss first)

## What We Handle Internally

- Notation design and glyph semantics
- Doctrine changes
- Grammar extensions (if ever needed)
- Core documentation

## Bug Reports

Bug reports via GitHub Issues are welcome! Please include:
- Which example or spell is affected
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce

## Sorcery Philosophy

Any accepted work must align with:
- **Minimal notation**: The 9-symbol grammar is intentionally constrained
- **Architecture over capture**: Sorcery is for designing, not recording
- **Intent preservation**: Spells transmit architectural intent across context boundaries
- **Casting discipline**: Quality comes from careful planning, not complex notation

## Why This Model?

Building a notation system requires tight semantic control. This ensures:
- Consistent glyph semantics across all examples
- No governance overhead or committee delays
- Clear direction for the project's future
- Quality control over what constitutes "proper" spells

The notation is open. The governance is centralized. This is intentional.

## Recognition

Helpful bug reports and community members are acknowledged in release notes.
If email collaboration leads to merged work, attribution will be given appropriately.
