# Case Studies

Real-world implementations using Sorcery methodology.

These are **not** the controlled dehydration/rehydration experiments (see [`examples/`](../examples/)). These are production implementations where sealed spellbooks were used to drive actual feature development.

## What's Here

| Case Study | Project | What Was Built | Author |
|------------|---------|----------------|--------|
| [CrabCamera Audio](CRABCAMERA_AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION.md) | CrabCamera v0.5.0 | Complete audio recording subsystem (10 spells) | Claude Opus 4.5 |

## Why Case Studies Matter

The `examples/` directory proves spells can transmit intent across context boundaries.

Case studies prove spells can **drive real production work**—where the goal isn't reconstruction fidelity, but shipping features with zero ambiguity and traceable requirements.

## Adding a Case Study

If you use Sorcery to build something real, document it:

1. What spellbook did you use?
2. What did you build?
3. What worked well?
4. What was hard?
5. Metrics (files created, tests, bugs found, etc.)

The goal is honest assessment, not marketing.

*Sorcery — because intent deserves to survive transmission.*
