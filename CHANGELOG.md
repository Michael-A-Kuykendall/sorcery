# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository’s doctrine and example methodology will be documented in this file.

This project is experimental and documentation-led. The primary “API surface” is the doctrine + glyph semantics.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Clarified the `>` glyph as **dependency (requires)** (not flow).
- Added a “Dependency Patterns” section describing three canonical dependency recipes (prerequisite, extension layering, variant refinement) using naming + `!/-/~` deltas to disambiguate intent.

### Notes
- This is a **doctrine clarification**, not a new glyph and not a semantic expansion of the grammar.
- Existing examples remain valid as historical artifacts; the new section is guidance to reduce ambiguity for future casting and for AI invokers.

## [2025-12-17]

### Added
